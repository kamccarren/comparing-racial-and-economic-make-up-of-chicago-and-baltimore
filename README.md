I chose to compare my homewown of Chicago to Baltimore. There was a lot of data to consider but I noticed a large amount of data relating specifically to females. I chose to look at teen births and I wanted to see what factors may influence this or be correlated. Most of the data was broken down into p1, p25, p50, p75 and p100 which I understood to be income percentiles. Additionally, I found it interesting that there is data for teen births rather than teen pregnancies as both states offer late-stage abortion and it is liklely easier to collect data from hospitals for births.

My initial goal was to create a combination chart to look at these factors within the same graph but this proved difficult. I believe the difficulty stemmed from the income percentiles which created too many variables for a comprehendible chart.

Chicago had fewer teen births even at the same income percentiles which was interesting. As income increased, the rate of teen births decreased at a fairly linear rate. Two parent household rates were similar in equivalent income percentiles, though Chicago sometimes had slightly higher rates. Overall, as income increased, the percentage of two parent households increased.

Progressive female income was quite interesting. There was no direct correlation to teen births; however, the trends were interesting. p1, p25 and p50 all had positive rates, with lower percentiles being much higher and decreasing dramatically. p75 was particularly interesting: Baltimore had a negative rate and Chicago has a positive rate. p100 had negative rates for both Baltimore and Chicago, though the rate for Baltimore was far more negative. This indicated that women have a worse financial outlook in Baltimore than in Chicago, which would only compound the issues a teenager would face if they gave birth.

While it is useful for me to compare Baltimore City and Chicago, I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago so Baltimore definitely has some differences. Furthermore, this is all correlational data compared on differnet charts so plotting these factors together or looking into factors that could determine causation would be critical in better understanding this issue. My largest takeaway from this project is how interconnected these issues are and how different cities face different issues, sometimes without clear explanations. Moving forward, I must really examine the data before making any blanket statements or trying to solve issues to ensure that I can address the root cause rather than applying a metaphorical band-aid.

#### Steps to analyze data:
1. Search database for Chicago and Baltimore
2. Isolate two rows of data of interest
3. Create pivot tables
