# miniproject1 - Correlation between teen births, two parent households and income

(Changed topic after presentation presentation but didn't want to change the name of my repository in case the link submitted through the form wouldn't work anymore.)

I chose to compare my homewown of Chicago to Baltimore. There was a lot of data to consider but I noticed a large amount of data relating specifically to females. I chose to look at teen births and I wanted to see what factors may influence this or be correlated. Most of the data was broken down into p1, p25, p50, p75 and p100 which I understood to be income percentiles. Additionally, I found it interesting that there is data for teen births rather than teen pregnancies as both states offer late-stage abortion and it is liklely easier to collect data from hospitals for births.

My initial goal was to create a combination chart to look at these factors within the same graph but this proved difficult. I believe the difficulty stemmed from the income percentiles and created too many variables for a comprehendible chart.



While it is useful for me to compare Baltimore City and Chicago, I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago so Baltimore definitely has some differences. Furthermore, My largest takeaway from this project is how interconnected many changes are and to really examine the data before making any blanket statements or without first performing rigorous analysis.

#### Steps to analyze data:
1. Search database for Chicago and Baltimore
2. Isolate two rows of data of interest
3. Create pivot tables

##### Teen Births
1. Compare racial data in 2000 and 2010
2. Convert data to percentages
3. Used stacked bar graphs to compare counties and racial make up

##### Two Parent Household
1. Create bar chart with poor share data 
2. Convert data to percentages.
3. Observe trends and use other information to make inferences
